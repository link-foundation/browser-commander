'browser-commander': patch

Include README.md in npm package

Added language-specific README.md files for each implementation:

- js/README.md: JavaScript/npm-specific documentation with installation and API usage
- rust/README.md: Rust/Cargo-specific documentation
- Root README.md: Common overview linking to both implementations

The npm package now includes the JavaScript-specific README.md directly from the js/ directory.
